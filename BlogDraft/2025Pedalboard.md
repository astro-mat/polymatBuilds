I get a bit silly with pedal boards. I seem to make one every gig I do. This is my attempt to make a multifunctional pedalboard that fulfils all roles live and in studio but is not silly big. I hate big pedalboards. I always feel very self-conscious on a small stage if I turn up with a massive board but I love the options that one gives me.

I figured with this board that I just needed to be able to carry the board around but I was not going to be putting it in planes so there was no need in investing in an expensive road case. I would just make a box out of plywood. I made the box with 8mm ply with rabbit joints, nailed and glued for strength. The finish was with shoe polish stain and then Briwax wax finish.

I love having a Digitech whammy, it is so expressive and multi-functional on a board but it is a large pedal. A small revelation was to put it on a shelf which allowed less width when used with a volume and a wah.

The interface between board and amps, guitar etc was done with a 3D printed box that I commissioned by 3Dlabs.ie. (https://3dlab.ie/) Â£d printing is a new area that I am currently exploring but am yet to delve in to too deeply.

The pedals are undecided at the moment. I wired everything up so that it can be changed easily. The board was designed to be changed easily as I have realised that I will always do that.
