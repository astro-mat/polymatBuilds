My house has a large combined kitchen and living room with vaulted ceiling. had always wanted to install a projector and screen but could never decide where it would go. 

Some friends brought around a projector for an impromptu movie night and suggested the perfect place that I had never considered.

What followed was a frantic week of obsession to something setup. I perused Facebook marketplace and found a well priced projector 1hr from me so I jumped on it. I couldn't justify the extra expense of a proper screen and so I decided to make one. I decided that I would limit myself to only things I had lying around the house.
