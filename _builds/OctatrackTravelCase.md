The Octatrack is a fantastic instrument/sampler. I wanted a way of protecting it during transport. I was not keen on the commercially available options so I decided to make a travel case.

The Octatrack features some threaded holes in the side which I could use to fix the unit into the case. It was made from 8mm plywood with rabbit joints for strength.

I Designed it in a way that the lid can be placed underneath and used to tilt the unit towards the user. I always find that devices like this are slightly annoying in use as they do not face the user - This was a neat solution.

I am slightly annoyed that the lid cannot be closed with a headphone adapter inserted which I always seem to need. This does increase the likelihood of forgetting it which can be disastrous before a performance!

The final missing touch is a carry handle but once I source a suitable one it will be simple to attach.
