I have always wanted to build a lap-steel guitar and decided to start collecting the parts for one about a year ago. I lost interest a bit an shelved it but came back to it a few months ago.

I decided to base the design on a Duesenberg Fairytail. I was going to include the adjustable capo design but decided to just get it done for now.

It is made from a single piece of Sapele as its a nice wood and was available in my local hardwood supplier.

I was very happy with the hand sawing of the headstock. First time using a japanese pull saw - very impressed!

The fretboard was made from off-cuts off walnut I have had for years. The fret spacers were ash from the Mosrite copy guitar build. The fret position markers were 4mm ball bearings from a draw runner.

There were lots of mistakes but overall, quite happy with the build. Now have to learn how to play it!
