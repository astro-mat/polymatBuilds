In 2017, I began work on my largest and most ambitious project to date. The design and construction of a home recording studio. I had been a bit obsessed with recording studios and the technology and techniques behind the recording of my favourite records. I longed for a place to learn and experiment with recording that would be a step up from the bedrooms and makeshift spaces I had used up until that point. With the purchase of my house in 2017 I finally had my chance.

I had available to me, a small garage area. It had originally been an old cowshed and consisted of a stone wall, rectangular building with a separate room within it that was currently a firewood storage area. The building was attached to the rest of the house via an extension. As the main living area was quite far away and the neighbours consisted mainly of cows, sound isolation was not of huge concern. This would be advantageous with regards to cost, design complexity and effort.

The floor area was approximately 4x4m with an elevated space in the roof above the fire wood storage shed that was about 2x4m.

The roof space was uninsulated and featured 5 Velux skylights

The space was being used as a workshop and was also full of junk left by the previous owner.

It was clear that a lot of design had to undertaking before anything else. I setup in the space a makeshift office and begun what would prove to be a lengthy design process
