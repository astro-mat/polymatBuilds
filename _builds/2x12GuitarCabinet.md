A simple 2x12 guitar cabinet. Using the dimensions from a Zilla Fat Boy cabinet. Open back but included a panel that can be attached to make it a closed back. Not sure where that is now!

Simple rabbit joint construction with TV front which was an experiment which I really liked. Stained the same red as my [Matrite Guitar](https://astro-mat.github.io/polymatBuilds/builds/Mosrite-Copy-Guitar/) to make it match. I Since regret this decision as I feel it would have looked better in a darker stain.

Currently is not being used. need to find a vintage 30 to stick in there.
