My house has always had a hideous, un-useful gap under the stairs. I needed to utilise the space more effectively and decided to create this set of shelving. The distance between each section is the same as a Lidl/Aldi cardboard boxe which I use to standardise all my storage. It also fits certain types of plastic boxes. Wooden rails keep these in place and are positioned so that the lids of plastic boxes are secured as they are pushed into place. This means that perishable food stuffs can remain safe from the mice that like to live nearby!
