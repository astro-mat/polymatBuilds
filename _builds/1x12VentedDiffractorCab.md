I love playing guitar with a full on Marshall 100W stack but it is a bit big. I wanted the ability to run high powered amp heads but into smaller cabinets. An interesting solution to this problem has been made by Barefaced Audio with their vented diffuser cabinets ["vented diffuser cabinets"](https://barefacedaudio.com/collections/avd-guitar-cabs/products/reformer-112).

Since the construction is detailed on their webpage, I though it would be fun to have a go at making my own version

The cabinet is made from 18mm plywood with box joints. for strength

The speaker is a new ["Celestion G12H-150 Redback"](https://celestion.com/product/g12h-150-redback/). Chosen for its high power handling characteristics and favourable reviews.

The grill cloth is quite saggy. I will fix this one day but it doesn't bother me enough to dismantle the whole cabinet.

It sounds quite good. It certainly doesn't sound like a small cabinet and I use it quite a lot. I would love to compare it one day to the real version
