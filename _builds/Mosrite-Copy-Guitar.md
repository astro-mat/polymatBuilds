I have always loved the shape of the old Mosrite guitars. I guess it started with an image of Kurt Cobain with his univox hi-flyer. This guitar had been on the drawing board for many years back when I had no workshop and could only dream of building it. Years later I found myself living in Ireland and had available the use of a workshop. I jumped at the chance to create the guitar of my dreams.

The body was a two piece of Irish ash from a local supplier. The neck came from a J mascis signature squier that I brought of Ebay. The pickups were TV jones classic Fitertrons with a classic + in the bridge. The vibrato was a very interesting design called a Stetsbar (https://www.stetsbar.com/index.html). It is very fluid and I like it a lot.

I was very happy with the resulting guitar. It is a bit heavy but I love the sound and feel. I have since learned that you never quite know how a guitar is going to end up until it is made and this was very good. I have the guitar these days strung with 11 gauge strings and tuned down to C for my solo, experimental guitar project.
