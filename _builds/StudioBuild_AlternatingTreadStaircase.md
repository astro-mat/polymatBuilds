One of the most challenging parts of the studio build was the alternating tread staircase

The design was first drawn out in sketchup. It was to be made out of shuttering ply. The design did not account for the length of a standard sheet of ply. This meant that the staircase had to be built in two pieces. A kind of box section made up the bases and then the staircase rested on this

The staircase was a real test of precision cutting. Everything had to fit together just right and the size proved a challenge.

The were also inconsistencies with the thickness of the ply used which caused a few issues

Looking down from the top along the line of the treads. It can be seen that everything is completely inline. In years to come, after I am gone, I can image people wondering how such precision was achieved with such primitive tools. Much like the way we marvel at the construction of the pyramids today!!!

I was very happy with how the staircase turned out. It is a real centrepiece of the studio. I still need to add some non slip surface to the treads and a handrail
