I have a 2yo Border Collie called Sox. These dogs require a lot of exercise and he is 100% ball obsessed! I usually use a plastic ball thrower device to propel the ball a satisfying distance. These are great but you do have to carry it around. One day, I came upon the idea of using a slingshot as a more manageable alternative. My train of thought then "lead" me (ahem!) to the idea of using the lead as the slingshot. This proved to be very effective and with practice I can propel the ball further than the dog thrower was able to!

I was thinking that i would have to develop a little pouch to hold the door and I may do that in the future but resting it there seems to work at the moment.
