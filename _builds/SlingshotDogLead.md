I have a 2yo Border Collie called Sox. These dogs require a lot of exercise and he is 100% ball obsessed! I usually use a plastic ball thrower device to propel the ball a satisfying distance. These are great but you do have to carry it around. One day, I came upon the idea of using a slingshot as a more manageable alternative. My train of thought then "lead" me (ahem!) to the idea of using the lead as the slingshot. This proved to be very effective and with practice I can propel the ball further than the dog thrower was able to!

I was thinking that I would have to develop a little pouch to hold the door and I may do that in the future but resting it there seems to work at the moment.

The technique is to hold the lead clasp with the throwing hand and rest thumb on the lead handle. The whole lot is swung around and when the thumb is released, the ball is released.
