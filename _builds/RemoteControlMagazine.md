A quick 30min build. I wanted to consolidate all my remotes into a handy, revolving "Magazine". This has probably been done before. Works quite well. Revolves nice and smoothly. It is a bit heavy but it remains on the coffee table pointing at all the devices it needs to. I certainly dont loose any remotes anymore!

Each remote is attached using 3M dual loc. The sky remote has that iky rubber stuff on that was all the rage in the noughties and some serious curves that made it difficult to attach to. Used a few cable ties on that one.
