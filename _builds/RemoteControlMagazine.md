A quick 1/2 build. I wanted to consolidate all my remotes into a handy, revolving "Magazine". This has probably been done before. Works quite well. Revolves nice and smoothly. It is a bit heavy but it remains on the coffee table pointing at all the devices it needs to. I certainly dont loose any remotes anymore!
